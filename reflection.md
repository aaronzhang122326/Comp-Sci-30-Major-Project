# Reflection

## What advice would you give to yourself if you were to start a project like this again?

My piece of advice is to walk out of my comfort zone more. Throughout this project, I definitely walked out of my comfort zone with coding and creation (such as generating random terrain), but to keep the project completable, there were aspects of coding that I did not explore. One of the things that I intended to do, but was not confident to explore was implementing more complex enemy movement paths with sorting. If I were to start a project like this, I would have bravely attempted to implement a complex enemy movement and more, even if the tasks and aspects are unfamiliar and unlikely to be completed.

## Did you complete everything in your "needs to have" list?

Yes, all of the current “needs to have'' list has been completed. In the process of making the project, I realized that some parts and functions of the project visioned in the beginning were unnecessary or unfitting with the game, so I adjusted the “needs to have” list (talked with Mr. Shellenberg). However, I have no doubt that I can make the functions that were deleted.  


## What was the hardest part of the project?

The hardest part of the project was the randomization of the map and terrain. In my opinion, making a randomized map requires a good understanding of 2 dimensional arrays and thought into how to effectively use it. Making the function, I ran into a lot of bugs, and I spent a tremendous amount of time debugging. 

## Were there any problems you could not solve?

Yes, the only problem that I was unable to solve was the distortion of the background music in my project. The problem is after the game runs for approximately 5 minutes, the background music will gradually distort. I attempted to fix the problem, but had no solution. Because the problem takes a long time to discover (like 10 minutes for the audio to be obviously distorted) and some advice online says the problem is unavoidable with p5js, I gave up on finding a solution.
