# Major Project Proposal

## Description

The major project will be a video game. The video game will be a 2 dimensional (above view) dungeon game where the player has to fight and complete levels. 

## Must Have List

- Using 2D arrays to randomly generate terrain and enemies.
- old* (Be able to pick up and use weapons)
- new* (Be able to use weapons)
- old* (Character being able to locate enemy direction and attack enemies)
- new* (Character being able to attack enemy)
- Enemies being able to locate and attack the player 
- displaying character data (health, damage) and enemy data
- Sound effects and music 

## Nice to Have List 

- Mini map of the terrain 
- Animations of sprite movement and attack
- Screen becomes red if the character is low on health
- Basic settings (menu, pause, restart, scoring system)
- Difficulty mode
