    -if keypressed and moving into wall, player will glitch back and forth 
    -difficulty mode does not work properly after restarting 
    -potions are too small to click and pick up

    Changes:
        - added 1 exta "if statement" each in moving horizontally and moving vertically to avoid glitching back and forth 
        - reset variables when restarting game

    - I would prefer to switch weapons using number keys instead of space
    - Is there no auto pick up? would be nice
    - Show the weapon that you are currently using instead of just the gun all the time
    - Would like to have a screen after death to congratulate on how long survived
    - Really like how the character has movement animation and gun display
    - helps to have the instructions on home screen
